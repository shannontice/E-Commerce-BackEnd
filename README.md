# E-Commerce-BackEnd

## Description
This application works on the back end to log information by category, tag, and product. These models also interact with one another so that the user can see which category and tag are attached to a certain product. Using backend GET,POST,PUT, and DELETE routes the information within the database can be updated and changed to reflect the users business and keep them organized.
